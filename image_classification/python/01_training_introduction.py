# # Introduction to Training Image Classification Models

# In this notebook, we will give an introduction to using [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) for image classification. We will use a small dataset of four differenet beverages to train and evaluate a model. We'll also cover one of the most common ways to store your data in your file system for image classification modelling.

# Import fastai. For now, we'll import all (`from fastai.vision import *`) so that we can easily use different utilies provided by the fastai library.

# In[3]:


import sys
sys.path.append("../")
import numpy as np
from pathlib import Path
# fastai and torch
import fastai
from fastai.vision import *
from fastai.metrics import accuracy
from torch.cuda import get_device_name
# local modules
from utils_ic.gpu_utils import gpu_info
from utils_ic.plot_utils import ResultsWidget, plot_pr_roc_curves
from utils_ic.datasets import Urls, unzip_url

print(f"Fast.ai version = {fastai.__version__}")


# In[4]:


print(f"Machine's GPU info = {gpu_info()} (memory unit = MiB)")
print(f"Fast.ai/Torch is using {get_device_name(0)}")


# This shows your machine's GPUs (if has any) and which computing device fastai/torch is using. The output cells here show the run results on [Azure DSVM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/) Standard NC6.

# Set some parameters. We'll use the `unzip_url` helper function to download and unzip our data.

# In[5]:


DATA_PATH     = unzip_url(Urls.fridge_objects_path, exist_ok=True)
EPOCHS        = 5
LEARNING_RATE = 1e-4
IMAGE_SIZE    = 299
BATCH_SIZE    = 16
ARCHITECTURE  = models.resnet50


# ---

# ## 1. Prepare Image Classification Dataset

# In this notebook, we'll use a toy dataset called *Fridge Objects*, which consists of 134 images of can, carton, milk bottle and water bottle photos taken with different backgrounds. With our helper function, the data set will be downloaded and unzip to `image_classification/data`.
# 
# Let's set that directory to our `path` variable, which we'll use throughout the notebook, and checkout what's inside:

# In[6]:


path = Path(DATA_PATH)
path.ls()


# You'll notice that we have four different folders inside:
# - `/water_bottle`
# - `/milk_bottle`
# - `/carton`
# - `/can`

# The most common data format for multiclass image classification is to have a folder titled the label with the images inside:
# 
# ```
# /images
# +-- can (class 1)
# |   +-- image1.jpg
# |   +-- image2.jpg
# |   +-- ...
# +-- carton (class 2)
# |   +-- image31.jpg
# |   +-- image32.jpg
# |   +-- ...
# +-- ...
# ```
# 
# and our data is already structured in that format!

# ## 2. Load Images

# To use fastai, we want to create `ImageDataBunch` so that the library can easily use multiple images (mini-batches) during training time. We create an ImageDataBunch by using fastai's [data_block apis](https://docs.fast.ai/data_block.html).
# 
# For training and validation, we randomly split the data by 8:2, where 80% of the data is for training and the rest for validation. 

# In[7]:


data = (ImageList.from_folder(path) 
        .split_by_rand_pct(valid_pct=0.2, seed=10) 
        .label_from_folder() 
        .transform(size=IMAGE_SIZE) 
        .databunch(bs=BATCH_SIZE) 
        .normalize(imagenet_stats))


# Lets take a look at our data using the databunch we created.

# In[8]:


data.show_batch(rows=3, figsize=(15,11))


# Lets see all available classes:

# In[9]:


print(f'number of classes: {data.c}')
print(data.classes)


# We can also see how many images we have in our training and validation set.

# In[10]:


data.batch_stats


# In this notebook, we don't use test set. You can add it by using [add_test](https://docs.fast.ai/data_block.html#LabelLists.add_test). Please note that in the **fastai** framework, test datasets have no labels - this is the unknown data to be predicted. If you want to validate your model on a test dataset with labels, you probably need to use it as a validation set.

# ## 3. Train a Model

# For the model, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, we'll use **ResNet50** architecture. You can find more details about ResNet from [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385).
# 
# When training a model, there are many hypter parameters to select, such as the learning rate, the model architecture, layers to tune, and many more. With fastai, we can use the `create_cnn` function that allows us to specify the model architecture and performance indicator (metric). At this point, we already benefit from transfer learning since we download the parameters used to train on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/).

# In[11]:


learn = cnn_learner(data, ARCHITECTURE, metrics=accuracy)


# Unfreeze our CNN since we're training all the layers.

# In[12]:


learn.unfreeze()


# We can call the `fit` function to train the dnn.

# In[13]:


learn.fit(EPOCHS, LEARNING_RATE)


# To see how our model has been trained, we can plot the accuracy and loss over the number of batches processed while training.

# In[14]:


# Plot the accuracy (metric) on validation set over the number of batches processed
learn.recorder.plot_metrics()
plt.gca().get_lines()[0].set_color("orange")
plt.gca().get_lines()[0].set_label("Validation")
plt.xlim([-1.0, 26.0])
plt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])
plt.xlabel("Batches processed")
plt.ylabel("Accuracy")
plt.legend()


# In[15]:


# Plot losses on train and validation sets
learn.recorder.plot_losses()


# ## 4. Evaluate the Model

# To evaluate our model, lets take a look at the accuracy on the validation set.

# In[16]:


_, metric = learn.validate(learn.data.valid_dl, metrics=[accuracy])
print(f'Accuracy on validation set: {100*float(metric):3.2f}')


# Now, analyze the classification results by using `ClassificationInterpretation` module.

# In[17]:


interp = ClassificationInterpretation.from_learner(learn)
# Get prediction scores. We convert tensors to numpy array to plot them later.
pred_scores = to_np(interp.probs)


# To see details of each sample and prediction results, we use our widget helper class `ResultsWidget`. The widget shows each test image along with its ground truth label and model's prediction scores. We can use this tool to see how our model predicts each image and debug the model if needed.
# 
# <img src="https://cvbp.blob.core.windows.net/public/images/ic_widget.png" width="600"/>
# <center><i>Image Classification Result Widget</i></center>

# In[18]:


w_results = ResultsWidget(
    dataset=learn.data.valid_ds,
    y_score=pred_scores,
    y_label=[data.classes[x] for x in np.argmax(pred_scores, axis=1)]
)
display(w_results.show())


# We can plot precision-recall and ROC curves for each class as well. Please note that these plots are not too interesting here, since the dataset is easy and thus the accuracy is close to 100%.

# In[19]:


# True labels of the validation set. We convert to numpy array for plotting.
true_labels = to_np(interp.y_true)
plot_pr_roc_curves(true_labels, pred_scores, data.classes)


# Let's take a close look how our model confused some of the samples (if any). The most common way to do that is to use a confusion matrix.

# In[20]:


interp.plot_confusion_matrix()


# When evaluating our results, we want to see where the model messes up, and whether or not we can do better. So we're interested in seeing images where the model predicted the image incorrectly but with high confidence (images with the highest loss).

# In[21]:


interp.plot_top_losses(9, figsize=(15,11))


# That's pretty much it! Now you can bring your own dataset and train your model on them easily.
