    "When building a deep learning model for computer vision, there are many parameters that we may want to tune in order get the kind of model we need. Sometimes, we want models that perform at the highest possible accuracy it can achieve. Other times, we want models that can be packed into small machines and optimized for mobility. By configuring these parameters, we can compose models to precisely fit our needs.\n",

    "## What to optimize for? <a name=\"introduction\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "As practitioners of computer vision, we want to be able to control what to optimize when building our models. Unless you are building a model for a Kaggle competition, it is unlikely that you can build your model with only its accuracy in mind. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, models must be able to run under varying scenarios with different constraints. Different scenarios requires us, as computer vision practitioners, to prioritize different characteristics over others.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in an IoT setting, where the inferencing device has limited computational capabilities, we need to design our models to have a small memory footprint. In contrast, medical situations often require the highest possible accuracy because the cost of mis-classification could impact the well-being of a patient. In this scenario, the accuracy of the model can not be compromised. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will explore different characteristics when modelling and help you come up with the optimal model for your specific scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology <a name=\"methodology\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore the charactistics of a model, we - the computer vision repo team - have conducted various experiments to explore the impact of different hyperparameters on a model's _accuracy_, _training duration_, _inference speed_, and _memory footprint_. In this notebook, we hope to outline some of the key findings so that you can make better decisions when settings parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use the results of our experiments to give us concrete evidence when it comes to understanding which parameters work and which dont. \n",
    "\n",
    "> To recreate these experiments, you can use the `util_ic.parameter_sweeper` module that lets us easily test different parameters when building models. You can learn more about how to use the module in the [Exploring Hyperparameters](.11_exploring_hyperparamters.ipynb) notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets <a name=\"methodology-datasets\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "For our experiments, we relied on a set of six different classification datasets. (These datasets can be downloaded directly from this repo using the `util_ic.datasets` module.)\n",

    "\n",
    "- __Accuracy__\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Accuracy is our evaluation metric for the model. It represents the average accuracy over 5 runs for our six different datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Training Duration__\n",
    "\n",
    "    The training duration is how long it takes to train the model. It represents the average duration over 5 runs for our six different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Inference Speed__ \n",
    "\n",
    "    The inference speed is the time it takes the model to run 1000 predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Memory Footprint__\n",
    "\n",
    "    The memory footprint is size of the model parameters saved as the pickled file. This can be achieved by running `learn.export(...)` and examining the size of the exported file.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Default Parameters <a name=\"methodology-default-parameters\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "For our experiments, we used following parameters:\n",

    "| Batch Size | 16 |\n",
    "| Dropout | 0.5 |\n",
    "| Weight Decay | 0.01 |\n",
    "| Momentum | 0.9 |\n",
    "| Epochs | 15 |\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that these parameters did not (in any significant way) affect the model's performance, training/inference speed, or memory footprint. So, for most datasets, we can use these as our default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "When running these experiments, we also set the number of epochs to 15, unless otherwise specified. For the datasets that we're using, training for 15 epochs might be more than is necessary. But one of the observations we've had is that it is extremely hard to overfit our model, so training for more epochs tends not to hurt the model's performance. However, the high number of epochs may mean that our average training durations are longer than what they could be. "

    "## Learning Rate and Epochs <a name=\"lr\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning rate tends to be one of the most important parameters to set when training your model. \n",
    "\n",
    "If your learning rate is set too low, training will progress very slowly since we're only making tiny updates to the weights in your network. However, if your learning rate is too high, it can cause undesirable divergent behavior in your loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to mitigate against a low learning rate is to make sure that you're training for many epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To efficiently build a model, we need to make sure that our learning rate is in the correct range. To find a good default learning rate, we've tested various learning rates on a range of datasets over two different epochs settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "![lr_comparisons](figs/lr_comparisons.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In both figures, we can see that a learning rate of 1e-3 and 1e-4 tends to work the best across the different datasets and the two settings for epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure on the left which shows the results of the different learning rates on different datasets at 15 epochs, we can see that a learning rate of 1e-4 does the best overall. But this may not be the case for every dataset. If you look carefully, there is a pretty significant variance between the datasets and it may be possible that a learning rate of 1-e3 works better than a learning rate of 1e-4 for some datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure on the right, both 1e-4 and 1e-3 seem to work well. At 15 epochs, the results of 1e-4 are only slightly better than that of 1e-3. However, at 3 epochs, a learning rate of 1e-3 out performs the learning rate at 1e-4. This makes sense since we're limiting the training to only 3 epochs, the model that can update its weights more quickly will perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we may learn towards using higher learning rates (such as 1e-3) if we want to minimize the training time, and lower learning rates (such as 1e-4) if training time is not constrained.\n",
