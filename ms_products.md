## What is Computer Vision
Computer vision is one of the most popular disciplines in industry and academia nowadays that aims to train computers
to understand the visual content found in images and videos. With computer vision, computers can identify
visual content and label it with confidence, detect potentially harmful content, get location of thousands of objects
within an image, identify image types and color schemes in pictures, and do
[much more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/home).

<summary><strong>Image Similarity</strong></summary>

Retail companies want to show customers products which are similar to the ones bought in the past.
Or companies with large amounts of data want to organize and search their images effectively.
Image similarity detection can solve such interesting problems.

<summary><strong>Object Detection</strong></summary>

Object Detection is one of the main problems in Computer Vision. Traditionally, this required expert knowledge to
identify and implement so called “features” that highlight the position of objects in the image.
Starting in 2012 with the famous [AlexNet paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf),
Deep Neural Networks are used to automatically find these features which lead to a huge improvement in the field
for a large range of problems.

<summary><strong>Image Segmentation</strong></summary>

In computer vision, the task of masking out pixels belonging to different classes of objects such as
water, barren and trees is referred to as image segmentation. Specifically, image segmentation is the process of
assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics.
