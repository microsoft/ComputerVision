# Image similarity

This directory provides examples and best practices for building image similarity systems. Our goal is to enable the users to bring their own datasets and train a high-accuracy model easily and quickly. To this end, we provide example notebooks with pre-set default parameters shown to work well on a variety of datasets, and extensive documentation of common pitfalls, best practices, etc.

The majority of state-of-the-art systems for image similarity use DNNs to compute a representation of an image (e.g. a vector of 512 floating point values), and define similarity between two images by measuring the L2 distance between the respective DNN representations.

A major difference between modern image similarity approaches is how the DNN is trained. A simple but quite powerful approach is to use a standard image classification loss - this is the approach taken in this repository, and explained in the [classification](../classification/README.md) folder. More accurate similarity measures are based on DNNs which are trained explicitly for image similarity, such as the [FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf) work which uses a Siamese network architecture. FaceNet-like approaches will be added to this repository at a later point.


## Notebooks

We provide several notebooks to show how image similarity algorithms can be designed and evaluated.

| Notebook name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [00_webcam.ipynb](./notebooks/00_webcam.ipynb)| Quick start notebook which demonstrates how to build an image retrieval system using a single image or webcam as input.
| [01_training_and_evaluation_introduction.ipynb](./notebooks/01_training_and_evaluation_introduction.ipynb)| Notebook which explains the basic concepts around model training and evaluation, based on using DNNs trained for image classification.|

## Getting Started

To setup on your local machine follow the [Getting Started](../classification/#getting-started) section in the image classification folder. Furthermore, basic image classification knowledge explained by the notebooks [01_training_introduction.ipynb](../classification/notebooks/01_training_introduction.ipynb) and [03_training_accuracy_vs_speed.ipynb](../classification/notebooks/03_training_accuracy_vs_speed.ipynb) is assumed.
