# Action Recognition

Action recognition (also often called activity recognition) consists of classifying different actions from a sequence
of frames in videos.

This directory contains example projects for building video-based action recognition systems.
Our goal is to enable users to easily and quickly train high-accuracy action recognition models with fast inference speed.

*Example of action recognition*


Currently, we provide two state of the art model implementations, Two-Stream [Inflated 3D ConvNet, I3D](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07750.pdf)
and RGB [ResNets with (2+1)D convolutions, R(2+1)D](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11248)
along with their example notebooks for fine-tuning on [HMDB-51 dataset](http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/resource/hmdb-a-large-human-motion-database/).
More details about the models can be found in [Models](#models) section below.

Each project describes independent SETUP process with a separate conda environment under its directory.
  
We recommend to use R(2+1)D implementation for its competitive accuracy (see below [comparison table](#comparison)) with much faster inference speed as well as less-dependencies on other packages.
We also provide the Webcam stream notebook for R(2+1)D to test real-time inference. 
  
Nevertheless, I3D implementation gives a good example of utilizing the two-stream approach for action recognition so that those who want to benchmark and/or tryout different approaches can use.

### Models

The R(2+1)D model was presented in \[2\] where the authors pretrained the model on [Kinetics400](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06950) and produced decent performance close to state of the art on the HMDB-51 dataset.
In [r2p1d](r2p1d) we demonstrate fine-tuning R(2+1)D model [pretrained on 65 million videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00561).
We use the pretrained weight from [https://github.com/moabitcoin/ig65m-pytorch](https://github.com/moabitcoin/ig65m-pytorch).

In [i3d](i3d) we show how to fine-tune I3D model. This model was introduced in \[[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07750.pdf)\]
and achieved state of the art in action classification on the HMDB-51 and UCF-101 datasets.
Here, we use models pre-trained on Kinetics from [https://github.com/piergiaj/pytorch-i3d](https://github.com/piergiaj/pytorch-i3d).

The following table shows the comparison between the reported performance in the original papers and our results on HMDB-51 dataset.
Please note that the accuracies from the papers are averages over 3 splits, while ours are based on the split 1 only.
Also, the original R(2+1)D paper used the model pretrained on Kinetics400 but we used the one pretrained on the 65 million videos which explains the higher accuracy (74.5% vs 79.8%).

| Model | Reported in the paper | Our results |
| ------- | -------| ------- |
| R(2+1)D RGB | 74.5 | 79.8 |
| I3D RGB | 74.8 | 73.7 |
| I3D Optical flow | 77.1 | 77.5 |
| I3D Two-Stream | 80.7 | 81.2 |


### Annotation
In order to train an action recognition model for a specific task, annotated training data from the relevant domain is needed. In [video_annotation](video_annotation), we provide tips and examples for how to use a best-in-class video annotation tool ([VGG Image Annotator](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/)) to label the start and end positions of actions in videos.

## State of the art

In the tables below, we list datasets which are commonly used and also give an overview of the state-of-the-art. Note that the information below is reasonably exhaustive and should cover most major publications until 2018. Expect however some level of incompleteness and slight incorrectness (e.g. publication year being off by plus/minus 1 year due) since the tables below were mainly compiled to give a high-level picture of where the field is and how it evolved over the last years.
