    "The goal of this notebook is to understand how to train a model with different parameters to achieve either a highly accurate but slow during inference model, or a model with fast inference but lower accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in IoT settings the inferencing device has limited computational capabilities. This means we need to design our models to have a small memory footprint. In contrast, medical scenarios often require the highest possible accuracy because the cost of mis-classification could impact the well-being of a patient. In this scenario, the accuracy of the model can not be compromised. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have conducted various experiments on diverse datasets to find parameters which work well in a wide variety of settings balancing high accuracy or fast inference. In this notebook, we provide these parameters so that your initial models can be trained without any parameter tuning. For most datasets, these parameters are close to optimal. In the second part of the notebook, we provide guidelines on how to fine-tune these parameters based on how they impact the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend first training your model with the default parameters, evaluating the results, and then fine-tuning parameters to achieve better results as necessary."

    "\n",
    "Learning rate or the step size is used when optimizing your model with gradient descent and tends to be one of the most important parameters to set when training your model. If your learning rate is set too low, training will progress very slowly since we're only making tiny updates to the weights in your network. However, if your learning rate is too high, it can cause undesirable divergent behavior in your loss function. Generally speaking, choosing a learning rate of 1e-4 was shown to work pretty well for most datasets. If you want to reduce training time (by training for fewer epochs), you can try setting the learning rate to 5e-3, but if you notice a spike in the training or validation loss, you may want to try reducing your learning rate.\n",

    "An _epoch_ is a full gradient descent iteration cycle across the DNN architecture. Unless your are working with small datasets, using around 15 epochs tends to work well in most cases. When it comes to choosing the number of epochs, a common question is - _Won't too many epochs cause overfitting_? It turns out that the accuracy on the test set typically does not get worse, even if training for too many epochs. Unless your are working with small datasets, using around 15 epochs tends to work pretty well in most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Batch Size__\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch size is the number of training samples you use in order to make one update to the model parameters. A batch size of 16 or 32 works well for most cases. Larger batch sizes help speed training time, but at the expense of an increased DNN memory consumption. Depending on your dataset and the GPU you have, you can start with a batch size of 32, and move down to 16 if your GPU doesn't have enough memory. After a certain batch size, improvements to training speed become marginal, hence we found 16 (or 32) to be a good trade-off between training speed and memory consumption. If you reduce the batch size, you may also have to reduce the learning rate.\n",

However, at only 3 epochs, a learning rate of 1e-3 out performs the smaller learning rates. This makes sense since we're limiting the training to only 3 epochs so a model that updates weights more quickly should perform better. Effectively a larger learning rate gets closer to the model convergence. This result indicates higher learning rates (such as 1e-3) may help minimize the training time, and lower learning rates (such as 1e-5) may be better if training time is not constrained. \n",
