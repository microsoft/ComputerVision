Azure ML, as we also call it, is a service that allows us to train, deploy, automate, and manage machine learning models, at scale, in the cloud.\n",

Such resource organizes and coordinates the actions of many other Azure resources to assist in executing and sharing machine learning workflows. In particular, an Azure ML Workspace coordinates storage, databases, and compute resources providing added functionality for machine learning experimentation, deployment, inferencing, and the monitoring of deployed models.\n",
