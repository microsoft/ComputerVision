    "Azure App Service allows users to build and host web apps, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of one's choice without managing infrastructure. It offers auto-scaling and high availability with support for both Windows and Linux. It also allows for automated deployments from Github, Azure DevOps, or any Git repo. \n",

    "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP feature that allows a web application running under a single domain to access resources from another domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "By default, web browsers enable [same origin policy](https://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy), a security mechanism to prevent webpages from calling APIs from a different domain than the one it is calling from. Under the same origin policy, one origin is allowed to send information to another origin, but is not permitted to receive information from another origin to prevent malicious websites from accessing confidential information from other websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "CORS provides a secure way to allow one origin to both call and receive information from APIs that are hosted in a different origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hence, setting the correct CORS policy is required if you are building a web application that is hosted in a different domain from the one hosting the deployed machine learning model's RESTful APIs.**\n",
