# Tools

This folder contains tools that the repo uses to perform tasks that are not
built into the library itself. 

| Folder/File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| /repo_metrics | The purpose of `repo_metrics` is to allow us to track this repo's usage over time. This will help us understand which notebooks are popular, and help us tailor our content to better fit our audience. |
| /create_dsvm.py | This script helps users easily create an Ubuntu Data Science Virtual Machine with a GPU. If you find the script to be out-dated or not working, you can create the VM using the Azure portal or the Azure CLI tool with a few more steps. |
